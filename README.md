# Abstraction 
Abstract: The "MelanomaDetector" app presents a groundbreaking solution addressing the 
critical need for early detection of melanoma cancer, distinguishing between benign and 
malignant cases. This paper outlines the development and implementation of an Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) powered application, aimed at providing users with a user-friendly tool for 
monitoring skin health, facilitating early melanoma detection, and prompting timely medical 
intervention. The proposed application, "MelanomaDetector," utilizes a Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) model, specifically a modified version of the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on 
the ImageNet dataset, for accurate melanoma detection. The development process encompasses 
seven key phases: data collection, preprocessing, model selection, model customization, app 
development, and testing & validation. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technology, this 
application seeks to enhance public awareness and education on melanoma, ultimately 
contributing to improved healthcare outcomes. We have achived highest accuracy 99 and 95 for 
training and testing respectively
